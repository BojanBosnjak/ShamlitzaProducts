# ShamlitzaProducts
This is program for internal bookkeeping in a store that has up to 500 articles. 
"Shamlitza" is showroom and design studio that has about 500 articles. 
Previously they used to work over Excel sheets and their Excel files were too big, therefore it was slow, and it was not easy to go over all the articles. 
This program is in Java, it is working over SQLite database (all the Excel sheets were imported in database and organised in way that it makes sense).
For this program I did not use anz OOP concept, and there is a problem that I discovered in the meantime which is called SQL injection.
Since I was not aware of that in that time, I didn't use Prepared Statement to secure my program.
Unfortunately "Shamlitza" changed their management and new management decided they don't need program like this, so I stopped further development. 
For this project I was unfortunate and my previous laptop died so this is all the code that I have saved. Database is also gone... 
The next planed stage for this project was to make it web app with images for all the articles they offer.
